    "summary": "In Arm software implementing the Armv8-M processors (all versions), the stack selection mechanism could be influenced by a stack-underflow attack in v8-M TrustZone based processors. An attacker can cause a change to the stack pointer used by the Secure World from a non-secure application if the stack is not initialized. This vulnerability affects only the software that is based on Armv8-M processors with the Security Extension.",
