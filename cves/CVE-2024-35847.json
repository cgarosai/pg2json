    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gic-v3-its: Prevent double free on error\n\nThe error handling path in its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() causes a double free\nwhen its_vpe_init() fails after successfully allocating at least one\ninterrupt. This happens because its_vpe_irq_domain_free() frees the\ninterrupts along with the area bitmap and the vprop_page and\nits_vpe_irq_domain_alloc() subsequently frees the area bitmap and the\nvprop_page again.\n\nFix this by unconditionally invoking its_vpe_irq_domain_free() which\nhandles all cases correctly and by removing the bitmap/vprop_page freeing\nfrom its_vpe_irq_domain_alloc().\n\n[ tglx: Massaged change log ]",
