    "summary": "In Combodo iTop 2.2.0 through 2.6.0, if the configuration file is writable, then execution of arbitrary code can be accomplished by calling ajax.dataloader with a maliciously crafted payload. Many conditions can place the configuration file into a writable state: during installation; during upgrade; in certain cases, an error during modification of the file from the web interface leaves the file writable (can be triggered with XSS); a race condition can be triggered by the hub-connector module (community version only from 2.4.1 to 2.6.0); or editing the file in a CLI.",
