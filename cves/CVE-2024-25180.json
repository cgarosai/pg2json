    "summary": "An issue discovered in pdfmake 0.2.9 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted POST request to the /pdf endpoint. NOTE: this is disputed because the behavior of the /pdf endpoint is intentional. The /pdf endpoint is only available after installing a test framework (that lives outside of the pdfmake applicaton). Anyone installing this is responsible for ensuring that it is only available to authorized testers.",
