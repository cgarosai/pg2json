    "summary": "Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u55, 6u65, and 7u45; JRockit R27.7.7 and R28.2.9; Java SE Embedded 7u45; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to 2D.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the issue is due to incorrect input validation in LookupProcessor.cpp in the ICU Layout Engine, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file.",
