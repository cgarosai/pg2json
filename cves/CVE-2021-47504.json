    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: ensure task_work gets run as part of cancelations\n\nIf we successfully cancel a work item but that work item needs to be\nprocessed through task_work, then we can be sleeping uninterruptibly\nin io_uring_cancel_generic() and never process it. Hence we don't\nmake forward progress and we end up with an uninterruptible sleep\nwarning.\n\nWhile in there, correct a comment that should be IFF, not IIF.",
