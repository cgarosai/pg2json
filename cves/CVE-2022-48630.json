    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ\n\nThe commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else\nbranch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is\nnot a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:\n\n    kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null\n\nThere are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but\nthey all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.\n\nTested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.",
