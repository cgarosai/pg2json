An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows NAT accesses the host.</p>\n",
