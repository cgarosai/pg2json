    "summary": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on version 1.4.1.\n\n",
