    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix information leakage in /proc/net/ptype\n\nIn one net namespace, after creating a packet socket without binding\nit to a device, users in other net namespaces can observe the new\n`packet_type` added by this packet socket by reading `/proc/net/ptype`\nfile. This is minor information leakage as packet socket is\nnamespace aware.\n\nAdd a net pointer in `packet_type` to keep the net namespace of\nof corresponding packet socket. In `ptype_seq_show`, this net pointer\nmust be checked when it is not NULL.",
