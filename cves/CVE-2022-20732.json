    "summary": "A vulnerability in the configuration file protections of Cisco Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access confidential information and elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper access permissions for certain configuration files. An attacker with low-privileged credentials could exploit this vulnerability by accessing an affected device and reading the affected configuration files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain internal database credentials, which the attacker could use to view and modify the contents of the database. The attacker could use this access to the database to elevate privileges on the affected device.",
