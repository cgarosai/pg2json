    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naudit: don't deref the syscall args when checking the openat2 open_how::flags\n\nAs reported by Jeff, dereferencing the openat2 syscall argument in\naudit_match_perm() to obtain the open_how::flags can result in an\noops/page-fault.  This patch fixes this by using the open_how struct\nthat we store in the audit_context with audit_openat2_how().\n\nIndependent of this patch, Richard Guy Briggs posted a similar patch\nto the audit mailing list roughly 40 minutes after this patch was\nposted.",
