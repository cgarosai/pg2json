    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach\n\nIf we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in\npanel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other\nDRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our\ndrm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()\nwill be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the\nconnector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid\nuse-after-free conditions.\n\nv2: Cleanup connector only if it was created\n\nv3: Add FIXME\n\nv4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block",
