    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: zynq: Prevent null pointer dereference caused by kmalloc failure\n\nThe kmalloc() in zynq_clk_setup() will return null if the\nphysical memory has run out. As a result, if we use snprintf()\nto write data to the null address, the null pointer dereference\nbug will happen.\n\nThis patch uses a stack variable to replace the kmalloc().",
