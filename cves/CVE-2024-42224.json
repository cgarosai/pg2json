    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Correct check for empty list\n\nSince commit a3c53be55c95 (\"net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Support multiple MDIO\nbusses\") mv88e6xxx_default_mdio_bus() has checked that the\nreturn value of list_first_entry() is non-NULL.\n\nThis appears to be intended to guard against the list chip->mdios being\nempty.  However, it is not the correct check as the implementation of\nlist_first_entry is not designed to return NULL for empty lists.\n\nInstead, use list_first_entry_or_null() which does return NULL if the\nlist is empty.\n\nFlagged by Smatch.\nCompile tested only.",
