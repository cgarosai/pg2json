    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock\n\nDAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in\n'dbgfs_target_ids_read()' while holding the corresponding\n'kdamond_lock'.  However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in\n'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock.  This can result in\na use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting the\ndestruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.",
