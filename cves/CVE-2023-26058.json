    "summary": "An XXE issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 FP2211 via an XML document to a Performance Manager page. Input validation and a proper XML parser configuration are missing. For an external attacker, it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically only be performed by an internal user.",
