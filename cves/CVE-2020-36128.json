    "summary": "Pax Technology PAXSTORE v7.0.8_20200511171508 and lower is affected by a token spoofing vulnerability. Each payment terminal has a session token (called X-Terminal-Token) to access the marketplace. This allows the store to identify the terminal and make available the applications distributed by its reseller. By intercepting HTTPS traffic from the application store, it is possible to collect the request responsible for assigning the X-Terminal-Token to the terminal, which makes it possible to craft an X-Terminal-Token pretending to be another device. An attacker can use this behavior to authenticate its own payment terminal in the application store through token impersonation.",
