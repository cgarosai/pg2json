    "summary": "An issue was discovered in Epikur before 20.1.1. The Epikur server contains the checkPasswort() function that, upon user login, checks the submitted password against the user password's MD5 hash stored in the database. It is also compared to a second MD5 hash, which is the same for every user (aka a \"Backdoor Password\" of 3p1kursupport). If the submitted password matches either one, access is granted.",
