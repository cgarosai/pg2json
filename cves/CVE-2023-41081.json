As\u00a0of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all\u00a0mappings must now be via explicit configuration.\u00a0Only mod_jk is affected\u00a0by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.\n\nHistory\n2023-09-13 Original advisory\n\n2023-09-28 Updated summary\n\n",
