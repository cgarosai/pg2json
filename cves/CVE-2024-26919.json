    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: ulpi: Fix debugfs directory leak\n\nThe ULPI per-device debugfs root is named after the ulpi device's\nparent, but ulpi_unregister_interface tries to remove a debugfs\ndirectory named after the ulpi device itself. This results in the\ndirectory sticking around and preventing subsequent (deferred) probes\nfrom succeeding. Change the directory name to match the ulpi device.",
