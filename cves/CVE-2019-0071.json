    "summary": "Veriexec is a kernel-based file integrity subsystem in Junos OS that ensures only authorized binaries are able to be executed. Due to a flaw in specific versions of Junos OS, affecting specific EX Series platforms, the Veriexec subsystem will fail to initialize, in essence disabling file integrity checking. This may allow a locally authenticated user with shell access to install untrusted executable images, and elevate privileges to gain full control of the system.
