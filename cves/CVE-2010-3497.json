    "summary": "Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2011 does not properly interact with the processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution. NOTE: the researcher indicates that a vendor response was received, stating that this issue \"falls into the work of our Firewall and not our AV (per our methodology of layers of defense).\"",
