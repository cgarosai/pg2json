    "summary": "touchbase.ai before version 2.0 is vulnerable to Open Redirect. Impacts can be many, and vary from theft of information and credentials, to the redirection to malicious websites containing attacker-controlled content, which in some cases even cause XSS attacks. So even though an open redirection might sound harmless at first, the impacts of it can be severe should it be exploitable. The issue is fixed in version 2.0.",
