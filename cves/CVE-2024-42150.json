    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: txgbe: remove separate irq request for MSI and INTx\n\nWhen using MSI or INTx interrupts, request_irq() for pdev->irq will\nconflict with request_threaded_irq() for txgbe->misc.irq, to cause\nsystem crash. So remove txgbe_request_irq() for MSI/INTx case, and\nrename txgbe_request_msix_irqs() since it only request for queue irqs.\n\nAdd wx->misc_irq_domain to determine whether the driver creates an IRQ\ndomain and threaded request the IRQs.",
