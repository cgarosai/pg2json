    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: dvb-frontends: avoid stack overflow warnings with clang\n\nA previous patch worked around a KASAN issue in stv0367, now a similar\nproblem showed up with clang:\n\ndrivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv0367.c:1222:12: error: stack frame size (3624) exceeds limit (2048) in 'stv0367ter_set_frontend' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than]\n 1214 | static int stv0367ter_set_frontend(struct dvb_frontend *fe)\n\nRework the stv0367_writereg() function to be simpler and mark both\nregister access functions as noinline_for_stack so the temporary\ni2c_msg structures do not get duplicated on the stack when KASAN_STACK\nis enabled.",
