    "summary": "The JetBackup \u2013 WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized back-up location changes in versions up to, and including 1.4.1 due to a lack of proper capability checking on the backup_guard_cloud_dropbox, backup_guard_cloud_gdrive, and backup_guard_cloud_oneDrive functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber to change to location of back-ups and potentially steal sensitive information from them.",
