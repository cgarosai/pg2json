    "summary": "The Pods \u2013 Custom Content Types and Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.10 (with the exception of 2.7.31.2, 2.8.23.2, 2.9.19.2). This is due to the fact that the plugin allows the use of a file inclusion feature via shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to create pods and users (with default role).",
