    "summary": "A flaw was found in the REST API in StarWind Stack. REST command, which manipulates a virtual disk, doesn\u2019t check input parameters. Some of them go directly to bash as part of a script. An attacker with non-root user access can inject arbitrary data into the command that will be executed with root privileges. This affects StarWind SAN and NAS v0.2 build 1633.",
