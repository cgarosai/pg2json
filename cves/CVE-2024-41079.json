    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvmet: always initialize cqe.result\n\nThe spec doesn't mandate that the first two double words (aka results)\nfor the command queue entry need to be set to 0 when they are not\nused (not specified). Though, the target implemention returns 0 for TCP\nand FC but not for RDMA.\n\nLet's make RDMA behave the same and thus explicitly initializing the\nresult field. This prevents leaking any data from the stack.",
