The vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of access controls. The \"Changelog\" and \"Help\" options available from the system tray context menu spawn an elevated instance of the user's default web browser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by selecting \"Run as Administrator\" from the context menu of an executable file within the file browser of the spawned default web browser. This may allow the attacker to execute privileged commands on the targeted system.",
