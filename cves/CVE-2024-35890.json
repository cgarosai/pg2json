    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngro: fix ownership transfer\n\nIf packets are GROed with fraglist they might be segmented later on and\ncontinue their journey in the stack. In skb_segment_list those skbs can\nbe reused as-is. This is an issue as their destructor was removed in\nskb_gro_receive_list but not the reference to their socket, and then\nthey can't be orphaned. Fix this by also removing the reference to the\nsocket.\n\nFor example this could be observed,\n\n  kernel BUG at include/linux/skbuff.h:3131!  (skb_orphan)\n  RIP: 0010:ip6_rcv_core+0x11bc/0x19a0\n  Call Trace:\n   ipv6_list_rcv+0x250/0x3f0\n   __netif_receive_skb_list_core+0x49d/0x8f0\n   netif_receive_skb_list_internal+0x634/0xd40\n   napi_complete_done+0x1d2/0x7d0\n   gro_cell_poll+0x118/0x1f0\n\nA similar construction is found in skb_gro_receive, apply the same\nchange there.",
