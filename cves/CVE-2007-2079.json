    "summary": "The ADONewConnection Connect function in adodb.php in XAMPP 1.6.0a and earlier for Windows uses untrusted input for the database server hostname, which allows remote attackers to trigger a library buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code via a long host parameter, or have other unspecified impact.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an issue in mssql_connect (CVE-2007-1411.1) in PHP, or an issue in the ADOdb Library, and the proper fix should be in one of these products; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in XAMPP.",
