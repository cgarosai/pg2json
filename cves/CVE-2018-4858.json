    "summary": "A vulnerability has been identified in IEC 61850 system configurator (All versions < V5.80), DIGSI 5 (affected as IEC 61850 system configurator is incorporated) (All versions < V7.80), DIGSI 4 (All versions < V4.93), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions < V8.11), SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions < V3.11), SICAM SCC (All versions < V9.02 HF3). A service of the affected products listening on all of the host's network interfaces on either port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service's client application on the host. In order to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to confidentiality and integrity of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.",
