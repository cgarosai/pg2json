    "summary": "Format string vulnerability in certain third party modifications to mod_dav for logging bad gateway messages (e.g. Oracle9i Application Server 9.0.2) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a destination URI that forces a \"502 Bad Gateway\" response, which causes the format string specifiers to be returned from dav_lookup_uri() in mod_dav.c, which is then used in a call to ap_log_rerror().",
