    "summary": "An issue was discovered in AvertX Auto focus Night Vision HD Indoor/Outdoor IP Dome Camera HD838 and Night Vision HD Indoor/Outdoor Mini IP Bullet Camera HD438. They do not require users to change the default password for the admin account. They only show a pop-up window suggesting a change but there's no enforcement. An administrator can click Cancel and proceed to use the device without changing the password. Additionally, they disclose the default username within the login.js script. Since many attacks for IoT devices, including malware and exploits, are based on the usage of default credentials, it makes these cameras an easy target for malicious actors.",
