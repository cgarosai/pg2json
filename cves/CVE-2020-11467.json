This product enables administrators to modify the helpdesk interface by editing /portal/api/style/edit-theme-set/template-sources theme templates, and uses TWIG as its template engine.

There, on could pass a crafted payload to trigger a set of POP gadgets in order to achieve remote code execution.",
