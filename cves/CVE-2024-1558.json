    "summary": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the `_create_model_version()` function within `server/handlers.py` of the mlflow/mlflow repository, due to improper validation of the `source` parameter. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a `source` parameter that bypasses the `_validate_non_local_source_contains_relative_paths(source)` function's checks, allowing for arbitrary file read access on the server. The issue arises from the handling of unquoted URL characters and the subsequent misuse of the original `source` value for model version creation, leading to the exposure of sensitive files when interacting with the `/model-versions/get-artifact` handler.",
