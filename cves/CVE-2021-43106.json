    "summary": "A Header Injection vulnerability exists in Compass Plus TranzWare Online FIMI Web Interface Tranzware Online (TWO) 5.3.33.3 F38 and FIMI 4.2.19.4 25.The HTTP host header can be manipulated and cause the application to behave in unexpected ways. Any changes made to the header would just cause the request to be sent to a completely different Domain/IP address. This is due to that the server implicitly trusts the Host header, and fails to validate or escape it properly. An attacker can use this input to redirect target users to a malicious domain/web page. This would result in expanding the potential to further attacks and malicious actions.",
