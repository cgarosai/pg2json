    "summary": "A vulnerability in the AppDynamics .NET Agent for Windows could allow an attacker to leverage an authenticated, local user account to gain SYSTEM privileges. This vulnerability is due to the .NET Agent Coordinator Service executing code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker with local access to a device that is running the vulnerable agent could create a custom process that would be launched with those SYSTEM privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is fixed in AppDynamics .NET Agent Release 21.7.",
