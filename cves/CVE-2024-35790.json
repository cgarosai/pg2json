    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute group\n\nThe DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace before\ntypec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means that\na sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp->hpd in\nhpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, as dev_get_drvdata() returns\nNULL in those cases.\n\nRemove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group as\ndefault for devices bound to the driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is\nnot used here otherwise the path to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant\nwith the ABI.",
