StaffCop 5.8, and other products, uses the same X.509 certificate private key for a root CA certificate across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging knowledge of this key, as originally reported for Superfish VisualDiscovery on certain Lenovo Notebook laptop products.",
