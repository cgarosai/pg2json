    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services \u2013 formerly known as Terminal Services \u2013 when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.\n",
