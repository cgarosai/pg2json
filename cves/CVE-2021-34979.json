    "summary": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6260 1.1.0.78_1.0.1 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of SOAP requests. When parsing the SOAPAction header, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-13512.",
