    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount\n\nThe KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2\nPGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the\nhost's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order\ncompound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0\nwhen they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.\n\nFix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page\nallocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of\nit from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().",
