Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes\na transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first\nand then sanitized with array_index_nospec.\n\nKasper Acknowledgements: Jakob Koschel, Brian Johannesmeyer, Kaveh\nRazavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU\nAmsterdam.",
