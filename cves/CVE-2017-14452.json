    "summary": "An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PubNub message handler for the \"control\" channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_cc_r, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"c_r\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability.",
