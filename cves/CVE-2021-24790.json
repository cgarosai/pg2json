    "summary": "The Contact Form Advanced Database WordPress plugin through 1.0.8 does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF checks in its delete_cf7_data and export_cf7_data AJAX actions, available to any authenticated users, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to call them. The delete_cf7_data would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP Object Injection if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is passed to the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.",
