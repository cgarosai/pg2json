    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndma-direct: Leak pages on dma_set_decrypted() failure\n\nOn TDX it is possible for the untrusted host to cause\nset_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an\nerror is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to\ntake care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)\nmemory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security\nissues.\n\nDMA could free decrypted/shared pages if dma_set_decrypted() fails. This\nshould be a rare case. Just leak the pages in this case instead of\nfreeing them.",
