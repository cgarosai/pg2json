If the number of\nevents in an event_group is greater than HNS3_PMU_MAX_HW_EVENTS, the\nmemory write overflow of event_group array occurs.\n\nAdd array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,\nand return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.\n\nThere are 9 different events in an event_group.\n[1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}",
