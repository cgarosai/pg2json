    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/i915/dpt: Make DPT object unshrinkable\n\nIn some scenarios, the DPT object gets shrunk but\nthe actual framebuffer did not and thus its still\nthere on the DPT's vm->bound_list. Then it tries to\nrewrite the PTEs via a stale CPU mapping. This causes panic.\n\n[vsyrjala: Add TODO comment]\n(cherry picked from commit 51064d471c53dcc8eddd2333c3f1c1d9131ba36c)",
