    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhabanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory\n\nOur code analyzer reported a uaf.\n\nIn gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()\nwith 2 refcount.\nIf hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb\nbranch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freed\nif other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id later,\nwhich is a potential uaf.\n\nMy patch add a variable 'id' to accept the value of cb->id before the\nhl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.",
