    "summary": "mntd_mount.c in mntd before 0.4.2 might allow local users to gain privileges via shell metacharacters in a remount option in the configuration file.  NOTE: It is not clear whether this is a vulnerability because there is not necessarily any common usage in which privilege boundaries are crossed.  Typical usage would restrict write access to the configuration file.",
