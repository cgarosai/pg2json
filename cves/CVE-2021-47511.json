    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: pcm: oss: Fix negative period/buffer sizes\n\nThe period size calculation in OSS layer may receive a negative value\nas an error, but the code there assumes only the positive values and\nhandle them with size_t.  Due to that, a too big value may be passed\nto the lower layers.\n\nThis patch changes the code to handle with ssize_t and adds the proper\nerror checks appropriately.",
