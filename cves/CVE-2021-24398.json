    "summary": "The Add new scene functionality in the Responsive 3D Slider WordPress plugin through 1.2 uses an id parameter which is not sanitised, escaped or validated before being inserted to a SQL statement, leading to SQL injection. This is a time based SQLI and in the same function vulnerable parameter is passed twice so if we pass time as 5 seconds it takes 10 seconds to return since the query is ran twice.",
