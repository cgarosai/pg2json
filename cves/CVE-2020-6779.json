    "summary": "Use of Hard-coded Credentials in the database of Bosch FSM-2500 server and Bosch FSM-5000 server up to and including version 5.2 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to log into the database with admin-privileges. This may result in complete compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the stored data as well as a high availability impact on the database itself. In addition, an attacker may execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.",
