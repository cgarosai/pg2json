    "summary": "Buffer overflow in NicoFTP 3.0.1.19 and earlier might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a long string in the \"Name of site\" field of an FTP account.  NOTE: because this program executes with the privileges of the invoking user, and because remote programs do not normally have the ability to create or modify FTP accounts in this program, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
