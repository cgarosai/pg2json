    "summary": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a log file with malicious code and getting a user to view the modified log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.",
