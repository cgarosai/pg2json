An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use this to gain further information from a user.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could include specially crafted OWA messages that could be loaded, without warning or filtering, from the attacker-controlled URL. This callback vector provides an information disclosure tactic used in web beacons and other types of tracking systems.</p>\n<p>The security update corrects the way that Exchange handles these token validations.</p>\n",
