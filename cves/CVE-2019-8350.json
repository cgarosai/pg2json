    "summary": "The Simple - Better Banking application 2.45.0 through 2.45.3 (fixed in 2.46.0) for Android was affected by an information disclosure vulnerability that leaked the user's password to the keyboard autocomplete functionality. Third-party Android keyboards that capture the password may store this password in cleartext, or transmit the password to third-party services for keyboard customization purposes. A compromise of any datastore that contains keyboard autocompletion caches would result in the disclosure of the user's Simple Bank password.",
