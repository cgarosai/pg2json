    "summary": "The default configuration of Cyberoam UTM appliances uses the same Certification Authority certificate and same private key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the presence of the Cyberoam_SSL_CA certificate in a list of trusted root certification authorities.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because the appliance \"does not allow import or export of the foresaid private key.",
