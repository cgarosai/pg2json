    "summary": "A vulnerability in the ingress traffic manager of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 520 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the web management interface of an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IPv4 TCP traffic that is destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted TCP packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web management interface to become unavailable, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability does not impact traffic that is going through the device or going to the Management Ethernet interface of the device.",
