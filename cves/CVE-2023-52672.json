    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npipe: wakeup wr_wait after setting max_usage\n\nCommit c73be61cede5 (\"pipe: Add general notification queue support\") a\nregression was introduced that would lock up resized pipes under certain\nconditions. See the reproducer in [1].\n\nThe commit resizing the pipe ring size was moved to a different\nfunction, doing that moved the wakeup for pipe->wr_wait before actually\nraising pipe->max_usage. If a pipe was full before the resize occured it\nwould result in the wakeup never actually triggering pipe_write.\n\nSet @max_usage and @nr_accounted before waking writers if this isn't a\nwatch queue.\n\n[Christian Brauner <brauner@kernel.org>: rewrite to account for watch queues]",
