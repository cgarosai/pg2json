    "summary": "A vulnerability in Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Software 11.6 could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to log in to the underlying Linux operating system. The vulnerability is due to a hard-coded account password on the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected system via Secure Shell (SSH) using the hard-coded credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the underlying operating system as a low-privileged user. After low-level privileges are gained, the attacker could elevate to root privileges and take full control of the device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc82982.",
