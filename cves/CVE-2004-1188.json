    "summary": "The pnm_get_chunk function in xine 0.99.2 and earlier, and other packages such as MPlayer that use the same code, does not properly verify that the chunk size is less than the PREAMBLE_SIZE, which causes a read operation with a negative length that leads to a buffer overflow via (1) RMF_TAG, (2) DATA_TAG, (3) PROP_TAG, (4) MDPR_TAG, and (5) CONT_TAG values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1187.",
