    "summary": "Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  In addition, it describes standard behavior (publication of revocation lists) and as such does not cross privilege boundaries.  Notes: the former description is: \"Check Point FireWall-1 allows remote attackers to obtain certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and other unspecified sensitive information via an HTTP request for the top-level URI on the internal certificate authority (ICA) port (18264/tcp).",
