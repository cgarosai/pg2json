An error path was missed though, that still takes\ndiscipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.\n\nIntermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured\noffline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.\nCall qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and\nthen a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking\ndiscipline_mutex.",
