They\u00a0\n\nsend MQTT credentials in response to HTTP/HTTPS requests from the cloud platform. These credentials are encoded using a hardcoded string into an MD5 hash. This string could be easily calculated by an unauthorized user who spoofed sending an HTTP/HTTPS request to the devices. This could result in the affected devices being temporarily disconnected from the cloud platform and allow the user to receive MQTT commands with potentially sensitive information. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",
