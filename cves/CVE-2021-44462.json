    "summary": "This vulnerability can be exploited by parsing maliciously crafted project files with Horner Automation Cscape EnvisionRV v4.50.3.1 and prior. The issues result from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in reads and writes past the end of allocated data structures. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability as an attacker must trick a valid user to open a malicious HMI project file.",
