    "summary": "The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) does not initialize the length variable when auth_type has a certain value, which has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE: the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions under which the uninitialized variable is used.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating \" The 'length' variable is only uninitialized if 'auth_type' is neither the 'KERBEROS_V4' nor 'GSSAPI'; this condition cannot occur in the unmodified source code.",
