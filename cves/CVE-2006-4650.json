    "summary": "Cisco IOS 12.0, 12.1, and 12.2, when GRE IP tunneling is used and the RFC2784 compliance fixes are missing, does not verify the offset field of a GRE packet during decapsulation, which leads to an integer overflow that references data from incorrect memory locations, which allows remote attackers to inject crafted packets into the routing queue, possibly bypassing intended router ACLs.",
