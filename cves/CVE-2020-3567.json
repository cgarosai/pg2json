    "summary": "A vulnerability in the management REST API of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests sent to the REST API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition that is due to high CPU utilization. Manual intervention may be required to recover the Cisco IND.",
