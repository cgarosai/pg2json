    "summary": "In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.",
