The error handing will call cpuhp_state_remove_instance()\nto call uncore pmu offline callback, which migrate the pmu context.\nSince that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free.\n\nUse cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of\ncpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute after\nthe PMU device has been failed to register.",
