    "summary": "A vulnerability in the TLS protocol implementation of legacy Cisco ASA 5500 Series (ASA 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540, and 5550) devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information, aka a Return of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat (ROBOT) attack. An attacker could iteratively query a server running a vulnerable TLS stack implementation to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions.
