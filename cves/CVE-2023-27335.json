This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing edgeAggregator. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the input parameters provided to the edgeAggregetor client.
