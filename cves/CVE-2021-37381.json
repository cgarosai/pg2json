    "summary": "Southsoft GMIS 5.0 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Attackers can access other users' private information such as photos through CSRF. For example: any student's photo information can be accessed through /gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the code in [1] is a random string generated according to the user's login related information. It can protect the user's identity, but it can not effectively prevent unauthorized access. The code in [2] is the student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].",
