    "summary": "In NICE Engage through 6.5, the default configuration binds an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces, without restricting registration of MBeans, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the RMI protocol by using the JMX connector. The observed affected TCP port is 6338 but, based on the product's configuration, a different one could be vulnerable.",
