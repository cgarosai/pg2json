    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm: nv04: Fix out of bounds access\n\nWhen Output Resource (dcb->or) value is assigned in\nfabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access to\ndac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is\nused as index there.\nThe 'or' argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must be interpreted as a\nnumber of bit to set, not value.\n\nUtilize macros from 'enum nouveau_or' in calls instead of hardcoding.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
