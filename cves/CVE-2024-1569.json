    "summary": "parisneo/lollms-webui is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled resource consumption. Attackers can exploit the `/open_code_in_vs_code` and similar endpoints without authentication by sending repeated HTTP POST requests, leading to the opening of Visual Studio Code or the default folder opener (e.g., File Explorer, xdg-open) multiple times. This can render the host machine unusable by exhausting system resources. The vulnerability is present in the latest version of the software.",
