    "summary": "The WOLF \u2013 WordPress Posts Bulk Editor and Manager Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpbe_create_new_term, wpbe_update_tax_term, and wpbe_delete_tax_term functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create, modify and delete taxonomy terms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Furthermore, the functions wpbe_save_options, wpbe_bulk_delete_posts_count, wpbe_bulk_delete_posts, and wpbe_save_meta are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing for plugin options update, post count deletion, post deletion and modification of post metadata via forged request.",
