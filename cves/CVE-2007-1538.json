    "summary": "McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5.0.i uses insecure permissions for certain Windows Registry keys, which allows local users to bypass local password protection via the UIP value in (1) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\McAfee\\DesktopProtection or (2) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Network Associates\\TVD\\VirusScan Entreprise\\CurrentVersion.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third-party researchers, stating that the default permissions for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE does not allow for write access and the product does not modify the inherited permissions. There might be an interaction error with another product",
