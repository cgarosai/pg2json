    "summary": "The MPS Agent in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central MSP build MSP build 10.0.486 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking: dcinventory.exe and dcconfig.exe try to load CSUNSAPI.dll without supplying the complete path. The issue is aggravated because this DLL is missing from the installation, thus making it possible to hijack the DLL and subsequently inject code, leading to an escalation of privilege to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
