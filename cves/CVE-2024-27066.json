    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc table\n\nWhen use_dma_api and premapped are true, then the do_unmap is false.\n\nBecause the do_unmap is false, vring_unmap_extra_packed is not called by\ndetach_buf_packed.\n\n  if (unlikely(vq->do_unmap)) {\n                curr = id;\n                for (i = 0; i < state->num; i++) {\n                        vring_unmap_extra_packed(vq,\n                                                 &vq->packed.desc_extra[curr]);\n                        curr = vq->packed.desc_extra[curr].next;\n                }\n  }\n\nSo the indirect desc table is not unmapped. This causes the unmap leak.\n\nSo here, we check vq->use_dma_api instead. Synchronously, dma info is\nupdated based on use_dma_api judgment\n\nThis bug does not occur, because no driver use the premapped with\nindirect.",
