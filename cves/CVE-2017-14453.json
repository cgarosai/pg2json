    "summary": "On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_ad_r, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"ad_r\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
