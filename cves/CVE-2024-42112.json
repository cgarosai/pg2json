    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: txgbe: free isb resources at the right time\n\nWhen using MSI/INTx interrupt, the shared interrupts are still being\nhandled in the device remove routine, before free IRQs. So isb memory\nis still read after it is freed. Thus move wx_free_isb_resources()\nfrom txgbe_close() to txgbe_remove(). And fix the improper isb free\naction in txgbe_open() error handling path.",
