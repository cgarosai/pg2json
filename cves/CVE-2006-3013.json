    "summary": "Interpretation conflict in resetpw.php in phpBannerExchange before 2.0 Update 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via an email parameter containing a null (%00) character after a valid e-mail address, which passes the validation check in the eregi PHP command.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the eregi PHP command and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpBannerExchange.",
