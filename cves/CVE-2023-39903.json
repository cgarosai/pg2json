    "summary": "An issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareManagement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection), or regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware repository site, as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the associated ismsnap maintenance data, in the same manner as a trusted party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and configured, and that the character \\ (backslash) is used in a user credential (i.e., user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host / firmware repository server. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-39379.",
