This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2150 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the SOAP API interface, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20559.",
