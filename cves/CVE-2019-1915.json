    "summary": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence (Unified CM IM&amp;P) Service, and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests that could change the password of a targeted user. An attacker could then take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.",
