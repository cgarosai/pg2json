    "summary": "The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of a concatenated string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which allows remote attackers to forge cookies by registering a username that results in the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by registering usernames beginning with \"admin\" to obtain administrator privileges, aka a \"cryptographic splicing\" issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.",
