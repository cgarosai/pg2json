    "summary": "The SonicWall Secure Remote Access server (version 8.1.0.2-14sv) is vulnerable to a Remote Command Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface. This vulnerability occurs in the 'extensionsettings' CGI (/cgi-bin/extensionsettings) component responsible for handling some of the server's internal configurations. The CGI application doesn't properly escape the information it's passed when processing a particular multi-part form request involving scripts. The filename of the 'scriptname' variable is read in unsanitized before a call to system() is performed - allowing for remote command injection. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the nobody user account. This is SonicWall Issue ID 181195.",
