Create WooCommerce Member Pages\" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.20 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_simple_request function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.",
