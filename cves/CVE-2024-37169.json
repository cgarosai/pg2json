Versions prior to 2.0.3 are vulnerable to arbitrary file read if a threat actor uses the Playright's screenshot feature to exploit the file wrapper. Version 2.0.3 mitigates this issue by requiring input URLs to be of protocol `http` or `https`. No known workarounds are available aside from upgrading.",
