    "summary": "SaferVPN 4.2.5 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its \"SaferVPN.Service\" service. The \"SaferVPN.Service\" service executes \"openvpn.exe\" using OpenVPN config files located within the current user's %LOCALAPPDATA%\\SaferVPN\\OvpnConfig directory. An authenticated attacker may modify these configuration files to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.",
