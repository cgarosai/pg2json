    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: Fix suspicious rcu_dereference_protected()\n\nWhen destroying all sets, we are either in pernet exit phase or\nare executing a \"destroy all sets command\" from userspace. The latter\nwas taken into account in ip_set_dereference() (nfnetlink mutex is held),\nbut the former was not. The patch adds the required check to\nrcu_dereference_protected() in ip_set_dereference().",
