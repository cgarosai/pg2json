This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing Secure Integration Server. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of OPC FileDirectory namespaces. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before using it to create a server object.
