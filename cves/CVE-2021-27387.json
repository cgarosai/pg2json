The femap.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing FEMAP files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-27399. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-12819)",
