    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference\n\nA NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPL\ndriver on platforms with CPU ID not listed in intel_rapl_common CPU\nmodel list.\n\nThis is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on such\nplatforms even if 'defaults_msr' is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8\n(\"powercap: intel_rapl: Allow probing without CPUID match\"). Thus the\nMMIO RAPL rp->priv->defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework.\n\nFix the problem by adding sanity check to ensure rp->priv->rapl_defaults\nis always valid.",
