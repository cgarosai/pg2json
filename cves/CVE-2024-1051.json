    "summary": "The List category posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'catlist' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.89.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes like 'title_tag'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
