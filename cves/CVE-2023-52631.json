The\n\"size\" comes from le32_to_cpu(attr->res.data_size) so it can't overflow\non a 64bit systems but on 32bit systems the \"+ 1023\" can overflow and\nthe result is zero.  This means that the kmalloc will succeed by\nreturning the ZERO_SIZE_PTR and then the memcpy() will crash with an\nOops on the next line.",
