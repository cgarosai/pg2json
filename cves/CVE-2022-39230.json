Versions 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are subject to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor. This issue allows a client of the API to retrieve more information than the client\u2019s OAuth scope permits when making \u201csearch-type\u201d requests. This issue would not allow a client to retrieve information about individuals other than those the client was already authorized to access. Users of fhir-works-on-aws-authz-smart 3.1.1 or 3.1.2 should upgrade to version 3.1.3 or higher immediately. Versions 3.1.0 and below are unaffected. There is no workaround for this issue.",
