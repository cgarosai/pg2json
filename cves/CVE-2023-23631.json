    "summary": "github.com/ipfs/go-unixfsnode is an ADL IPLD prime node that wraps go-codec-dagpb's implementation of protobuf to enable pathing. In versions priot to 1.5.2 trying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.\nIf you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic. This is caused by bogus fanout parameter in the HAMT directory nodes. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
