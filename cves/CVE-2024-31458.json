Prior to version 1.2.27, some of the data stored in `form_save()` function in `graph_template_inputs.php` is not thoroughly checked and is used to concatenate the SQL statement in `draw_nontemplated_fields_graph_item()` function from `lib/html_form_templates.php` , finally resulting in SQL injection.
