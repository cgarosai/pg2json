Authentication to the Oracle WCI search service uses this hardcoded password and cannot be customised by customers. An adversary able to access this service over a network could perform search queries to extract large quantities of sensitive information from the WCI installation. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.",
