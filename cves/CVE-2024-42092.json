In case of broken\nDT due to any error this value can be any. Without this value validation\nthere can be out of chips->irqs array boundaries access in\ndavinci_gpio_probe().\n\nValidate the obtained nirq value so that it won't exceed the maximum\nnumber of IRQs per bank.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
