    "summary": "The IIS/ISAPI specific code in the Apache Tomcat JK ISAPI Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.42 that normalised the requested path before matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing Tomcat via the reverse proxy.",
