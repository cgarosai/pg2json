    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: kexec: Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path\n\nIf the kexec crash code is called in the interrupt context, the\nmachine_kexec_mask_interrupts() function will trigger a deadlock while\ntrying to acquire the irqdesc spinlock and then deactivate irqchip in\nirq_set_irqchip_state() function.\n\nUnlike arm64, riscv only requires irq_eoi handler to complete EOI and\nkeeping irq_set_irqchip_state() will only leave this possible deadlock\nwithout any use. So we simply remove it.",
