    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/proc: do_task_stat: use sig->stats_lock to gather the threads/children stats\n\nlock_task_sighand() can trigger a hard lockup.  If NR_CPUS threads call\ndo_task_stat() at the same time and the process has NR_THREADS, it will\nspin with irqs disabled O(NR_CPUS * NR_THREADS) time.\n\nChange do_task_stat() to use sig->stats_lock to gather the statistics\noutside of ->siglock protected section, in the likely case this code will\nrun lockless.",
