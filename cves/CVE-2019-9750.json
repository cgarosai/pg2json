    "summary": "In IoTivity through 1.3.1, the CoAP server interface can be used for Distributed Denial of Service attacks using source IP address spoofing and UDP-based traffic amplification. The reflected traffic is 6 times bigger than spoofed requests. This occurs because the construction of a \"4.01 Unauthorized\" response is mishandled. NOTE: the vendor states \"While this is an interesting attack, there is no plan for maintainer to fix, as we are migrating to IoTivity Lite.\"",
