    "summary": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WA855RE Firmware Ver: 855rev4-up-ver1-0-1-P1[20191213-rel60361] Wi-Fi extenders. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the first-time setup process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation on first-time setup requests. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to reset the password for the Admin account and execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-10003.",
