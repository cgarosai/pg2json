    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work\n\nSyzbot reported memory leak in tcindex_set_parms(). The problem was in\nnon-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work().\n\nIn tcindex_set_parms() new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from\nold one are copied to new one, but not the perfect hash. Since\ntcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old\ntcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.",
