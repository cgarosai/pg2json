    "summary": "An issue was discovered in Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX 2021.1.224. It allows unauthorized access to MicrosoftAjax.js through the Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd file. This may allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server and execute code. To exploit, one must use the parameter _TSM_HiddenField_ and inject a command at the end of the URI. NOTE: the vendor states that this is not a vulnerability. The request's output does not indicate that a \"true\" command was executed on the server, and the request's output does not leak any private source code or data from the server",
