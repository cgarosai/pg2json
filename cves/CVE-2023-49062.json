    "summary": "Katran could disclose non-initialized kernel memory as part of an IP header. The issue was present for IPv4 encapsulation and ICMP (v4) Too Big packet generation. After a bpf_xdp_adjust_head call, Katran code didn\u2019t initialize the Identification field for the IPv4 header, resulting in writing content of kernel memory in that field of IP header.
