    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: avoid a use-after-free when BO init fails\n\nnouveau_bo_init() is backed by ttm_bo_init() and ferries its return code\nback to the caller. On failures, ttm_bo_init() invokes the provided\ndestructor which should de-initialize and free the memory.\n\nThus, when nouveau_bo_init() returns an error the gem object has already\nbeen released and the memory freed by nouveau_bo_del_ttm().",
