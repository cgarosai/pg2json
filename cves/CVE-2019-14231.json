One could exploit the points parameter in the ob_get_results ajax nopriv handler due to there being no sanitization prior to use in a SQL query in getResultByPointsTrivia. This allows an unauthenticated/unprivileged user to perform a SQL injection attack capable of remote code execution and information disclosure.",
