    "summary": "A vulnerability in the remote management access control list (ACL) feature of the Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the remote management ACL. The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of the ACL decision made during the ingress connection request to the remote management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a connection to the management IP address or domain name of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured remote management ACL. This can occur when the Remote Management configuration parameter is set to Disabled. This vulnerability affects Cisco CVR100W Wireless-N VPN Routers running a firmware image prior to 1.0.1.24. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc14457.",
