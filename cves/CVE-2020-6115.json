    "summary": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the cross-reference table repairing functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.\u2019s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242. While searching for an object identifier in a malformed document that is missing from the cross-reference table, the application will save a reference to the object\u2019s cross-reference table entry inside a stack variable. If the referenced object identifier is not found, the application may resize the cross-reference table which can change the scope of its entry. Later when the application tries to reference cross-reference entry via the stack variable, the application will access memory belonging to the recently freed table causing a use-after-free condition. A specially crafted document can be delivered by an attacker and loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.",
