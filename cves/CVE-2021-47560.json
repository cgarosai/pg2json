    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware\n\nWhen processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,\nthe driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local\nports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a\nnetdev.\n\nThis can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling\nnetif_carrier_{on,off}().\n\nFix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU\nport. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.",
