    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missed\n\nIf hv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTER\nhandler cannot perform VF register successfully as the register call\nis received before netvsc_probe is finished. This is because we\nregister register_netdevice_notifier() very early( even before\nvmbus_driver_register()).\nTo fix this, we try to register each such matching VF( if it is visible\nas a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.",
