    "summary": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fix memory leak in compat_insnlist()\n\n`compat_insnlist()` handles the 32-bit version of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST`\nioctl (whenwhen `CONFIG_COMPAT` is enabled).  It allocates memory to\ntemporarily hold an array of `struct comedi_insn` converted from the\n32-bit version in user space.  This memory is only being freed if there\nis a fault while filling the array, otherwise it is leaked.\n\nAdd a call to `kfree()` to fix the leak.",
